# CreditApprovalPrediction
 
This credit card approval prediction was created as part of a project at Maastricht University's Data Analytics class. 
It's a different approach when compared to your usual credit card scoring model.
For this project, we decided to follow an interesting storyline as if we were banktellers from the Marvel universe. 
Our client: Thor.
The model was trained to identify the class of the applicant (in this case, good applicant vs. bad applicant). 
Now, this doesn't mean that you wouldn't get your credit approved.
It just means that you would be classified as a bad applicant and (possibly) a more careful review would be needed to your application.
If you have any questions regarding the process, or any recommendations, please let me know via emial: jorge.lvt@outlook.com

Thanks!
